Do not work off my branch, create your own. and work completely off your own :)

Create a component file mimicking the HelloBack file for your HelloWorld code.

App.js is only for navigating and importing!

Then make a pull request for me to approve. Checkout to another new branch and in another new component build this website:

http://www.polkadotssalon.uk/ 

Make sure it's imported into App.js

Images don't have to be the same and tables can have one field. Don't do all the prices.

Then we'll break out components together. If you get stuck beforehand lemme know
